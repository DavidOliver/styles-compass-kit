# Styles Compass Kit



## Usage

Put this kit in its own `kit` directory within your styles source directory, preferably as a submodule of your project to allow easy updating.

    git submodule add git://github.com/DavidOliver/styles-compass-kit.git kit

Copy the files in the `starting-point` directory to your styles source directory. These copies are the files to edit. Files within the kit directory should not be edited so as not to cause complications when updating the kit.

In `_base.sass`, configure the configurable variables as required, uncommenting lines as necessary.
